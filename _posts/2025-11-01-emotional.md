As per the source code given, the website was rendering using ejs. I realised the website was vulnerable to SSTI attacks after it kept resetting upon submitting an SSTI polyglot to `/setEmoji`. 


To make sure, I submitted with the payload `<%= 7*7 %>`, and the server replied with 49! I then researched, and found a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/NketiahGodfred/EJS-ssti-exploit/blob/main/exploit.sh) with a payload that allows executing shell code on server. And then I submitted:

```js
<%= global.process.mainModule.constructor._load("child_process").execSync("ls"); %>
```

I then just catt'd out the flag.
