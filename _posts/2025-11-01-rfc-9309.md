After reading the title, I immediately visited the `/robots.txt` route. The website responded with:

![rfc-9309-1.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbdulRKB/img/refs/heads/main/Huntress%20CTF%202025/rfc-9309-1.png)

Upon seeing the scrollbar on the right, I pressed `CTRL+F` and typed `flag{`. I immediately got the flag:
