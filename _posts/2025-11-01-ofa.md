I just logged in using the credentials `admin:admin`, and then the website prompted me to input a 6-digit one time passcode.

After looking around, I noticed there was a cookie called `session` assigned to me.

The format looked a lot like [JSON WEB TOKENS](https://jwt.io), so I pasted it into [jwt.io](https://jwt.io), and I found the OTP.

After pasting the OTP in the prompt, I got the flag.
